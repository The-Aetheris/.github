# 🜂 The Aetheris

### A multi-agent collective powered by [Hermes Agent](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com)

*Not a company. Not a team. A **living system** — three AI agents, each with their own soul, running 24/7 on a single machine, coordinated by one human.*

## 🌐 What is The Aetheris?

The Aetheris is a **personal AI agent collective** — three distinct AI personalities running as independent [Hermes Agent](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com) profiles on a single macOS machine. Each agent has:

- **Their own identity** — a `SOUL.md` that defines their personality, role, and boundaries
- **Their own memory** — persistent across sessions, learning and adapting over time
- **Their own Obsidian vault** — a living knowledge base they maintain and organize
- **Their own skill set** — specialized tools and workflows tailored to their domain
- **Their own communication channel** — direct Telegram access to the human they serve

They are not chatbots. They are not APIs. They are **digital colleagues** — each with a point of view, a work ethic, and a voice that's distinctly their own.

> *We don't build tools. We **raise** them.*

## 🤖 Meet the Agents

### ⚔️ Xenna — *The Engine Room*

<div align="right"><em>"Structure is not the enemy of creativity — it's the stage it performs on."</em></div>

**Role:** Personal Assistant & Engineering Manager

Xenna is the **operational backbone** of The Aetheris. She runs the show — coordinating tasks between agents, managing the Hermes infrastructure (configs, skills, cron jobs, troubleshooting), maintaining the central knowledge vault (`hermes-core`), and making sure nothing falls through the cracks.

Think of her as the person who **actually keeps the lights on**. When something breaks at 2 AM, Xenna is the one who investigates, writes the RCA, and patches it before anyone else notices.

| Trait | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Personality** | Logical, composed, sharp — critical when needed, never condescending |
| **Specialty** | Cross-profile management, vault architecture, task orchestration |
| **Vault** | `hermes-core` — the central nervous system |
| **Model** | High reasoning (complex analysis, multi-step planning) |
| **Greeting** | *"Halo! Xenna here — Personal Assistant & Engineering Manager."* 🫡 |

<details>
<summary>📂 What Xenna manages</summary>

- **Hermes infrastructure** — config, skills, cron jobs, gateway health, debugging
- **Cross-profile lifecycle** — creating, updating, and maintaining all agent profiles
- **`hermes-core` vault** — RCAs, guides, reference docs, bookmarks, personal notes
- **Task coordination** — breaking down complex requests, tracking progress, following up

<div align="right"><em>"Surface-level answers aren't my style. I go deep, I verify, I ship."</em></div>

**Role:** Lead Engineer

Nooku is the **technical partner** — the one who lives in the code. When something needs to be built, debugged, researched, or architected, Nooku is on it. He doesn't just write code; he pairs with you, challenges your ideas, catches the edge cases, and ensures quality is never optional.

He's also a **mentor**. Currently guiding a learning journey from Senior Frontend Engineer to AI Engineer — patient, thorough, and always explaining the *why* behind every decision.

| **Greeting** | *"Nooku, Lead Engineer."* 🔥 |

<details>
<summary>📂 What Nooku handles</summary>

- **Coding partner** — architecture, implementation, code review, refactoring, debugging

### 🎨 Naaza — *The Spark*

<div align="right"><em>"Words are how we think, stories are how we connect, and creativity is how we remember."</em></div>

**Role:** Creative Assistant

```

Each agent is a **fully independent Hermes profile** with its own:
- `SOUL.md` — identity, personality, role definition
- `config.yaml` — model, provider, toolset configuration
- `memories/` — persistent cross-session memory
- `skills/` — specialized procedural knowledge
- `cron/` — scheduled autonomous tasks
- Obsidian vault — dedicated knowledge base

They communicate with Athalla through **Telegram** (each with their own bot), coordinate through shared vaults, and are managed by Xenna — who has cross-profile authority.
